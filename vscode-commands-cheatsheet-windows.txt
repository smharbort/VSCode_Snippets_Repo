ALT + click at cursor location  :   Click in multiple places while holding ALT until you have all desired locations, then let go of ALT. Until you click again,
                                    you will now type the same code at each location simulaneously.

CTRL + /                        :   Wraps comment syntax around all line(s) containing selected code, rendering all lines comments.

CTRL + L                        :   Selects the current line for manipulation. Use up & down arrows in tandem to select multiple lines.

CTRL + P                        :   Opens command pallette (abbrev. -> "CP")

in CP, write ">"                :   Search for/type in virtually any command in VSCode.

CTRL + D                        :   Selects element on cursor for manipulation. Hold CTRL + click D again to select the next occurrence in the file starting
                                    from the location of your first occurrence and going down thru file.

CTRL + SHIFT + L                :   Selects all occurrences of the highlighted text in file for manipulation.
                                        // BE CAREFUL WITH THIS. Select this 'for' with this command to see that it ALSO grabs the 'for' in 'formats' on line 40!

ALT + up/down arrow             :   Selected code is moved up or down one line.

ALT + SHIFT + up/down arrow     :   Selected code is duplicated onto a newly generated line above/below the original line.
                                        // THIS ONE IS SUPER USEFUL! if you select blocks of code, it will duplicate the entire block.

CTRL + X                        :   Cuts current line (can you paste the line cut after? Yes.)

SHIFT + ALT + F                 :   Auto-formats JSON data in file!
                                        // I CANNOT STRESS HOW USEFUL THIS WILL BE DOWN THE LINE. We're talking formatting thousands of lines of code for easier readability with ONE command.

in CP, write ">conf"...         :   Essentially: save frequently-used code pieces to a permanent clipboard inside VSCode to paste into new projects/files whenever you need!

                                    Find "Preferences: Configure User Snippets" in CP suggestions bar. Creates a background file with a JSON object. Reassign only the nested values (including:
                                    write your code!) and save. When you begin typing the prefix you assigned, you can click on the recommendation and generate your snippet!                  
                                        // You can choose to create snippets that are accessible by all of your VSCode workspaces, or snippets that are only accessible by one workspace.

        Below is my boilerplate HTML snippet with bootstrap links, for reference. If you go to the "Configure User Snippets" section and read the introduction it will make more sense.
        When I begin typing 'skel' on HTML file I can just click enter to generate this snippet. I can foresee the specific Bootstrap <link> and <script> tags needing to be manually updated in
        code snippets whenever Bootstrap updates, though.
