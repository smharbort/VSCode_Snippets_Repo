#       Useful VSCode Snippets If You Want Them

###     Made a repo so I can update without constantly having to post in discord if I make more

###     Test snippets file is just for me so I can make sure it looks right before pushing to GitHub

###     Copy/paste from .txt into your global snippets file, rename the prefixes to your liking,  
###     and double check that you have the correct indendations/commas between snippets, and you have  
###     them for life
