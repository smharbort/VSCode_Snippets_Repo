# Useful VSCode Snippets If You Want Them

## Made a repo so I can update without constantly having to post in discord when I make more  

## To Use
1. in GitHub, choose useful-snippets.txt
2. copy/paste from .txt into your global snippets file  
(type > in search bar in VSCode, should be at the top 'Snippets: Configure Snippets' -> 'globalSnippets.code-snippets')
3. rename the prefixes to your liking
4. double check that indentations/commas between snippets is correct & save

## They're now yours for life. Edit them to your liking!

## Current Snippets:
1. HTML boilerplate with current Bootstrap CDN links
2. console.log() shortcut
3. HTML table skeleton
