# Useful VSCode Snippets If You Want Them

## Made a repo so I can update without constantly having to post in discord if I make more  

## To Use
1. copy/paste from .txt into your global snippets file
2. rename the prefixes to your liking
3. double check that indentations/commas between snippets is correct

## They're now yours for life. Edit them to your liking!

## Current Snippets:
1. HTML boilerplate with current Bootstrap CDN links
2. console.log() shortcut
3. HTML table skeleton

#### Test snippets file is just for me so I can make sure it looks right before pushing to GitHub
